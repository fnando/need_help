need\_help
=========

A simple help system using Rails Engine.

Installation
------------

Just install the plugin with `script/plugin install git://github.com/fnando/need_help.git`.

Usage
-----

1) Run the task `rake help:sync` to copy the required migrations. Run `db:migrate` to update the database schema.

2) Create the file `config/help/help.yml`. This file will hold all categories and topics. The syntax is quite simple:

	"Category 1":
	  "Topic 1.1": topic11.textile
	  "Topic 1.2": topic12.textile
	"Category 2":
	  "Topic 2.1": topic21.textile
	  "Topic 2.2": topic22.textile

3) Create the files you specify (*.textile) on `config/help` directory.

4) Import the topics with `rake help:update`

5) Start the server `script/server` and go to `http://localhost:3000/help` to view the help index.

6) This plugin has two dependencies: <http://github.com/fnando/has_permalink> and <http://github.com/fnando/has_markup>.

Customization
-------------

To customize the view, just create two views at `app/views/help/index.erb.html` and `app/views/help/show.erb.html`. There's three instance variables: `@categories`, `@category` and `@topics`, depending on the view you're working.

You need to set two keys for your locale file:

	en:
	  back_to_top: "Back to top"
	  see_all: "See all"

Here's some CSS:

	body {
		font-family: Georgia;
		font-size: 14px;
		margin: 0;
		padding: 40px;
	}

	.help h3,
	.help-summary h2 a {
		color: #900;
		font-size: 18px;
		margin-bottom: 0;
	}

	.help-summary h2 a {
		text-decoration: none;
	}

	.help-summary h2 a:hover {
		text-decoration: underline;
	}

	.help p {
		line-height: 160%;
		margin: 0;
		padding-bottom: 10px;
	}

	a {
		color: rgb(54, 113, 161);
	}

	p.top a {
		font-weight: bold;
	}

	p.top a:after {
		content: "â†‘";
	}

	ul.topics {
		margin-left: 0;
		padding-left: 20px;
	}

	ul.topics li {
		margin: 5px 0;
	}

	h2#index {
		font-size: 24px;
		margin: 0;
	}

	.help {
		border-top: 1px dotted #888;
	}
